ðŸ‘‹ Hello,

I am Ekta Khurana, a data analyst with experience of working various tools which helps in turning the data into information and then information into business. 
My Data Analysis task gave me exposure to various technologies/tools like Qlik Sense, Power BI , SAP , BigQuery, Excel , Google sheets, Jira and Python.
Some of these projects are based on work I've done as a data analyst, while others are based on tutorials or textbook examples. When posting a script based on a tutorial, I've included a note about it.
